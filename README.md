# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
### Description:

The IMDb Movie Analysis project investigates factors influencing the success of movies on IMDb, as defined by high ratings. The analysis provides actionable insights for stakeholders in the movie industry to make informed decisions
### Problem Statement: 

The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects.

### Data Cleaning: 
This step involves preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis. It includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types if necessary, and possibly feature engineering.

### Data Analysis:
Here, you'll explore the data to understand the relationships between different variables. You might look at the correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc. You might also want to consider the year of release, the actors involved, and other relevant factors.

### Five 'Whys' Approach: 
This technique will help you dig deeper into the problem. For instance, if you find that movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings, you can ask "Why?" repeatedly to uncover the root cause. Here's an example:

- Q: "Why do movies with higher budgets tend to have higher ratings?"
- A: They can afford better production quality.
